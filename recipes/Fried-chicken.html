     <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>

     <br>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>

     <br>
        <li>Flour</li>
           All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.
     <br>
        <li>Seasonings</li>

            You can add more spices and seasonings to taste.
